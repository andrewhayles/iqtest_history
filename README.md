# Project Title

> This project performs various analyses on IQ test scores.  

## About The Project

This solves the problem of having a large number of I.Q. scores with various data on when they were taken, who the author was, what type of I.Q. subtest they were, etc and not knowing much about the averages and the dependencies in the data by creating many visualizations and doing various statistical tests.

### Built With

* Python
* Web browser
* Laptop

## Getting Started

All you need is a CSV file with your scores in the format that I have in mine.  Please see scores.csv to match the format of the CSV file so the scripts will run smoothly.

### Prerequisites

The libraries used are pandas, scipy, numpy, itertools, statsmodels.api, statsmodels.stats.weightstats, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, and scipy.stats - these all need to be installed for the scripts to work correctly.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/andrewhayles/iqtest_history.git
    ```
2.  Install packages
3.  Run scripts
